# API Templates🚀

Welcome to the API Templates repository! 🌐 Here, I've meticulously crafted backend templates in an array of languages, transforming them into the indispensable building blocks for my personal projects. These templates don't just power my current endeavors; they're the seeds for a garden of future innovations.

## Unleashing the Power of Docker 🐳

Each template is elegantly dockerized, ensuring seamless deployment across diverse platforms. So, whether you're on Windows, macOS, or Linux, spin up your chosen backend effortlessly.

## Project Architecture

Dive into the heart of this repository with a glance at the project structure:

### Language-Specific Branches

Explore the diversity in each language, with dedicated branches for stability and experimentation:

- `main`: The stable branch housing fully functional templates.
- `dev`: The dynamic playground where new features come to life.

### Folder Hierarchy

Within each language project, a familiar structure awaits:

- **BACKEND**: The powerhouse containing:
  - `config`: Configuration wizardry.
  - `database`: The vault of database secrets.
  - `middleware`: Crafted middleware for custom magic.
  - `schemas`: Parsing objects for data alchemy.
  - `services`: The maestros, our controllers.
  - `views`: The path connectors linking controllers to the world.

- **mysql**: Your trusty MySQL companion.
- **redis**: The heartbeat of caching.
- **nginx**: The guardian of the gateways.

## Feast Your Eyes on the Languages 🌐

Pick your flavor from our curated list of API templates:

- Rust 🦀
- Go 🚀
- Python 🐍
- C++ 🧑‍💻

## Branching Out

Each language has its own playground:

- `rust-dev`
- `go-dev`
- `python-dev`
- `cpp-dev`

These development branches are where the magic happens, where new features take their first breaths. When the magic is polished and ready, find the stable versions in the respective language branches.

## Summon the Code Spirits 🚀

Prepare to summon the code spirits with a stroke of your command brush:

```bash
docker compose up --build
```

In the realm of digital sorcery, this incantation sets the wheels in motion, breathing life into your chosen template. As you execute this spell, the mystical energies of Docker converge, orchestrating a symphony of bits and bytes to manifest your creation. Witness the magic unfold seamlessly—no wizardry required, just a dash of command-line charm. 🧙‍♂️💻✨

**Explore, iterate, and innovate! Let's build the future together.**
